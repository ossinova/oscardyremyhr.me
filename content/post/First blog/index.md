## Why start a blog?

As a technologist with a passion to explore unknown territories I have decided to share my journey as I deep dive into new and exciting topics (at least for me).

## What can you expect?

Through my socials (or here on my portfolio/blog page) you can follow me as I will share interesting posts to the following series (as a start):

- [Monthly Passion](../../tutorials/monthlypassion/)
  - A series in where I deep dive into something I stumbled on that I have commited to learn and explore a given month
- [What is {X}, and why you should {X} it](../../tutorials/whatisx/)
  - A series that involves sharing my findings on new technologies / topics I have stumbled on I think you should know about


## What sort of content will you focus on?

I see this blog as a forum for self growth, and so I envision my content will be rather technical. Luckily, my blog uses Markdown (I will post a entry regarding this soon! Stay tuned üëç). This allows me to do things such as this:

```python
# Some random python code appeared!

isBlog = True
if isBlog == True:
  print("Awesome, this will be fun!")
else:
  print("Bye bye!")
```

How cool is that? It definetly turned me on. 

Topics in which I will most likely write about includes:

- PySpark
- Regex
- Cron
- Python
- Markdown
- Data Adoption
- Data Engineering
- Data Science (potentially, I wanna learn more)

## Blog schedule

Do the nature of this being my first attempt to write material my ambitions to be overly active is quite small. However, I have a goal to start with at least 2 entries a month and scale up or down based on my time.
